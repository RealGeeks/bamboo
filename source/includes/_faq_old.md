# Frequently Asked Questions

## Accounts FAQ

**What does "single sign-on" actually mean?**

It would mean that if you logged into http://accounts.realgeeks.com/ you could then just type in the address to your website administration page http://www.yourrealgeekssite.com/admin/ and you would be automatically logged in, and vice-versa.

**How do permissions work?**

You can login to http://accounts.realgeeks.com, select your site from the list provided and then review permissions for users you've chosen to include on your site. If your user doesn't exist, you can simply create a new account for them. An email will be sent out with their login/credentials to the email you've included. The same user may be added to multiple sites, just by typing in the same email address multiple times. They can have different permissions for every site you own.

**Why was I charged $5 in Billing?**

This is a common error having to do with a $5 placeholder that all Accounts are charged before it is then removed and replaced with the proper amount. Please contact us using the Real Geeks Support Form http://support.realgeeks.com and we can adjust this for you.

**What’s to come?**

We're going to be extending the permissions system to include all of the permissions currently available in the lead manager.
There are going to be additional accounts permissions added as well, potentially including the ability to give someone else control over the billing for your website.

**I'm still lost, what should I do?**
