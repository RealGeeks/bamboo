### Buyer Leads List ###

<html><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tfZpKM6oEA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></html>

The Buyer Lead's List is intended as a tool for Seller agents to help sell themselves to a potential seller lead. The idea is to pull up this list and show that potential seller how many Buyer Leads your company has looking in the seller's area.

[<img src="images/crm/buyers-list.jpg"/>](images/crm/buyers-list.jpg)

If the Seller's agent is visiting with a lead, they can simply pull up this list, doing any additional filtering they wish, using the CRM's search and scroll through all the Buyer leads existing in the system. All these leads will be secure as we do not display any contact information and they are only designated by First name and Last initial. All previous permission based security is in place where non-admin agents will not have access to click into or modify any lead that is not assigned to them.

#### Access to Buyer Leads List ####

To access this feature non-admin agents will need an admin to grant them access via permissions. After permission to this feature has been granted, simply head to your Lead's list page and click the arrow next to *"All Leads"*, *"Full Leads"*, etc and select *"Buyers List"*

[<img src="images/crm/access-buyers-list.jpg"/>](images/crm/access-buyers-list.jpg)

### Exporting Leads ###

Exporting leads is a feature controlled by your Site Admin.  If you are wishing to use this feature, please contact your site admin to obtain the permissions to do so.

Our lead manager exports leads into a CSV file.  This stores the lead's information in a structured table format which is great for use with Excel or Numbers. Your exported file will contain your leads contact information, source, notes, number of saved searches, last communication date and more. It will not contain the comprehensive list of activities the lead performed on your site.

#### Filtering Export ####

You are able to filter which leads are exported to your CSV file.  You can do this two different ways:

1. Create a [CRM Advanced Search](#finding-leads)

2. Check the boxes to the far right of the leads you wish to include in your export.

Note: If you skip this process, clicking the CSV button will automatically export your entire list of leads.

[<img src="images/crm/export1.jpg"/>](images/crm/export1.jpg)

#### How to Export ####


After your permissions are set, you will see this button at the top right of your lead's screen: 

[<img src="images/crm/export2.jpg"/>](images/crm/export2.jpg)

To export your leads follow these steps:

1. Go to your "Leads" tab.

2. Either use the advanced search or check the leads from the list of leads.

3. Click on the CSV button.

4. Check your email and download the attachment.

[<img src="images/crm/export4.jpg"/>](images/crm/export4.jpg)



#### Setting Permissions ####

If you are a site admin and would like to allow a particular agent to export leads, follow these steps to set their permissions:

1. In the Lead Manager, go to Agents.

2. Click on the agent for which you would like to set permissions.

3. Scroll down to Permissions.

4. Check off the box next to Export Leads.

### Leads Tab ###

After clicking the **Leads** tab, you will be taken to the leads listing page. 

If you just logged in, the ***All*** saved search [1] is used automatically. If you've been logged in for a while and selected other saved searches, the most recent one will be used. 

The search starts at page 1, and you can change pages by selecting from the ***Go to page*** [2] dropdown. 

To download a csv of your leads, click the ***CSV*** [3] button and it will prompt you to make a decision of checking certain leads or downloading all of your leads. 

To update more than one lead at a time, whether it's changing the Type, Tags, etc, you can do it here [4].

The ***Assign*** [5] button will bulk assign the checked leads to a specified agent/lender. 


To use the ***Workflows - Drips*** [6] and ***eBlast*** [7] buttons, you will need to activate the email drip feature.

The ***Delete*** [8] button will show for admins and any agent who has permission to delete leads. To delete a lead, you would check the box to the right of the lead and press delete.

To create a new lead manually, click the ***New*** [9] button.

Initially, the leads are sorted by ***Start Date*** [10] in descending order (most recent first). The sort criteria can be changed by clicking on any of the other column headings, and the sort order can be changed by clicking a column header a second time. 

[<img src="images/crm/navigationleadstab.jpg"/>](images/crm/navigationleadstab.jpg)

#### Finding Leads ####

Under the **Leads** tab, there are tabs that will list your leads by Activity Today, All My Leads, My New Leads, New and Unassigned. These are handy for filtering different kinds of leads, for example, unassigned leads if you're an admin, or buyer and seller leads if you're an agent.

You can also search through the leads by entering terms into the search field on the right to perform a simple search. For complex searches, click **Advanced Search** to expand the advanced form. Here you can set up several search criteria by filling out the drop-downs and other fields and clicking the **Search** button, all on a single row of the advanced search form. You can create several links to saved searches by specifying criteria in the advanced search and saving it. Note: The criteria for a given row isn't added until you click that row's **Search** button.


[<img src="images/crm/savedsearchesrar.jpg"/>](images/crm/savedsearchesrar.jpg)

#### Saving Searches ####

If you choose to save an advanced search, first, you'll be asked to name the search. 

[<img src="images/crm/savingsearchrar1.jpg"/>](images/crm/savingsearchrar1.jpg)

Then, a new saved search link will appear near the top of the page. This saved search will look and work like the default saved searches (such as **New**), except you can delete it by clicking its X.

[<img src="images/crm/deletingsavedsearchrar.jpg"/>](images/crm/deletingsavedsearchrar.jpg)

#### Creating a Lead ####

Usually, leads are generated automatically by user activity on the site. You can, however, create a lead manually by clicking the **New Lead** button from the **Dashboard** or the **New** button from the **Leads** tabs. This takes you to a lead creation form, with required fields marked with asterisks. Fill this form out to your satisfaction, then click **Save** to create the lead. If you're an admin, you may now [assign it to someone](#lead-assignment).

[<img src="images/crm/newlead.jpg"/>](images/crm/newlead.jpg)

#### Importing Leads in Bulk ####

Sometimes you will have the need to add more than one or a large number of leads to the Lead Manager. Maybe you are bringing over your existing client list, or collected a lot of contacts at an Open House. Whatever the reason you can accomplish this with our [Bulk Import Tool](https://leads.realgeeks.com/lead_imports/new).  Simply follow the instructions, you will download our template CSV file and copy over your existing leads in the correct format using a spreadsheet program like Excel or Numbers. The Bulk Import tool can also be navigated to via the [New Lead Page](https://leads.realgeeks.com/leads/new). 

To learn how to import your lead, click [here](#bulk-lead-import-tool).

#### Lead Assignment ####

Discussed [here](#lead-assignment).

#### Lead Details ####

A lead is a potential customer and his contact information [1] (and possibly information about a secondary contact [2]), details on the sort of home he'd like to buy or sell [3], and information about the transaction [4]. Login as your lead to view/add saved searches [5].

[<img src="images/crm/leads-detail1.jpg"/>](images/crm/leads-detail1.jpg)

#### Follow-ups ####

You can schedule follow-ups right from the *Lead Detail* page. Click the **Schedule Follow-up** under the lead's main details. Then fill in the fields and click *Save*. Here is an example follow-up:

Notice how a reminder will be sent to the user assigned to the lead. The user assigned to the lead is indicated in the drop-down labeled **User**.

Upcoming follow-ups are listed in the [Dashboard tab](#dashboard). Completed follow-ups are recorded in just above **Activity History** on the *Lead Detail* page. Both completed and upcoming follow-ups are listed in the [Calendar tab](#calendar).

[<img src="images/crm/followuprar.jpg"/>](images/crm/followuprar.jpg)

#### Activities ####

An activity can be one of a few different events relevant to a lead. The types of activities are:

  Automatic |                |                |
-------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
    search performed | saved search created | saved search removed |
    contact emailed | property viewed | scheduled a showing |
    favorite property added | favorite property removed |
    user logged in | user visited site |

  Manual |                |                |
-------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
    called | left voicemail | bad number |
    emailed | met in person | made an offer |
    contract accepted | note |

A lead needs to have an account in order to **schedule a showing**. If the lead doesn't have an account and clicks the "Schedule Showing" button on a property detail page, they need to fill out the sign up form first and then when they click it again and fill out the schedule, the activity will show up in the activity section of the lead's detail page. 

[<img src="images/crm/scheduleshowingactivity.jpg"/>](images/crm/scheduleshowingactivity.jpg)

The manual activity types can be created from the *Lead Detail* page. To do so, make sure the **Activity** tab is selected. Then fill in the three fields and click the *Save* button.

[<img src="images/crm/activityrar.jpg"/>](images/crm/activityrar.jpg)

Previous activities for the lead in question are available under *Activity History* on the *Lead Detail* page. There is an Activity History search box, and the activities can be sorted by name or date.

#### Email ####

The Email tab will have a list of the template emails you create in your "Settings" > "Templates" > "Template Emails"

[<img src="images/crm/emailrar.jpg"/>](images/crm/emailrar.jpg)

The "Standard follow up email" is an example email template that was created.

#### Workflow ####

The Workflow tab will have a list of the workflows you will create. This is only available if you have the drip feature activated (only after you have gone live!).

[<img src="images/crm/workflowyas.jpg"/>](images/crm/workflowyas.jpg)

#### Text ####

If you have the texting tool activated, you can use this tab for texting your lead. You can either open the text chat box or opt out the lead of texting. If you choose to opt the lead out, a pop up confirmation box will appear. 

[<img src="images/crm/textyas.jpg"/>](images/crm/textyas.jpg)

#### Bombbomb ####

If you have a Bombbomb account, you can send your leads a bombbomb. To learn how to link your bombbomb account with your CRM, click [here](#bombbomb).

[<img src="images/crm/bombbombyas.jpg"/>](images/crm/bombbombyas.jpg)


#### Interacting with leads ####

From the lead detail page, there are several ways of interacting with the person behind the lead. Obviously, you can use various bits of contact information attached to the lead. You can even send an email from the lead detail page by clicking the **Email** button.

It can also be useful to log in as a user, for example to create a saved search for him or to provide one-on-one support. This is done by click the **Login As User** button near the top right of the lead detail page.

### Bulk Import Tool ###

The Bulk Import Tool is great for uploading many leads into the lead manager at the same time.  

**You can import leads even if the site is not yet live.**

#### How do I import leads? ####

  - Go to your **Leads** tab and click on the **"New"** button located at the top-right corner.
  - Click on the **"Bulk Import"** button.
  - Upload your CSV or Excel file via the **"Choose File"** button. If you don't have one, you can click on the **"Download Template"** button to receive a blank CSV template file and input your lead data into the file.

[<img src="images/crm/import_csv_1.jpg"/>](images/crm/import_csv_1.jpg)

  - After choosing your file, click on the **"Upload"** button.

[<img src="images/crm/import_csv_2.jpg"/>](images/crm/import_csv_2.jpg)

  - Set the default values for important field columns if they are not give for the lead. Also decide if these leads should be marked as new in the system. Then click the **"Next"** button.

[<img src="images/crm/import_csv_3.jpg"/>](images/crm/import_csv_3.jpg)

  - Verify that the settings are correct and then click on the **"Start Import"** button.

[<img src="images/crm/import_csv_4.jpg"/>](images/crm/import_csv_4.jpg)

  - If your file is an export file from certain companies (e.g. CINC), our system will attempt to automatically proceed with importing the file. Otherwise, you will be brought to a "Header Matching" page. From here, you will match the columns from your import file with the fields within our system. During this step, please be sure to **Save** or **Skip** your change for the column.

[<img src="images/crm/import_csv_5.jpg"/>](images/crm/import_csv_5.jpg)
[<img src="images/crm/import_csv_5_1.jpg"/>](images/crm/import_csv_5.jpg)

  - Once you are done, click on the **"Review Changes"** button.
  - At this point, you can view a summary of the matching done. For any columns that weren't matched, you can have them added to the "Important Notes" field or the "MISC Notes" field.

[<img src="images/crm/import_csv_6.jpg"/>](images/crm/import_csv_6.jpg)

  - You will then be brought to the status page for the import, where you can see the results of the import once it is done. So you can see the number of full and partial leads imported. If any leads failed to be imported, you can view the reason why they failed to be imported from this page as well or from a results CSV file downloaded via the **"Results"** button.

[<img src="images/crm/import_csv_7.jpg"/>](images/crm/import_csv_7.jpg)

#### Exported CSVs from the following companies will work automatically ####

                |                |                |                |

### Saved Searches ###

####Property Update Emails####

Saved searches cause leads to receive property update emails from RealGeeks.

When a lead signs up on your site, their search is automatically saved and the lead will begin to receive update emails based on the search results. You and the lead have the ability to later revisit this search and edit the search specifications and notification settings.

These emails do not support the editing of wordage.  However, they will pull in the assigned agent's signature.

####Create a saved search####

1. Login to leads.realgeeks.com and click on the Leads tab.
2. Click on the Lead's name. To find a specific lead, you may want to filter through an advanced search.
[<img src="images/crm/saved_searches_1.jpg"/>](images/crm/saved_searches_1.jpg)
3. Click the "Login as user" button in the top right corner.
[<img src="images/crm/saved_searches_2.jpg"/>](images/crm/saved_searches_2.jpg)
4. Press the "New Search" button on the right.
[<img src="images/crm/saved_searches_3.jpg"/>](images/crm/saved_searches_3.jpg)
5. Refine your search and press search.
6. Press the "Save this Search" button above the search results.

[<img src="images/crm/saved_searches_4.jpg"/>](images/crm/saved_searches_4.jpg)

Name the search and set the update email frequency. Then save.

**Important notes about saved searches:**

You will want to refine your search before using the Polygon Tool.  Polygon Saved Searches can not be edited at this time.
If a lead has multiple saved searches, the property update emails will be combined only if the notifications are set to the same frequency.

####Creating a Super Saved Search####

If your lead is interested in having a saved search based on a field that is not on the advanced search, you can log into the lead's account from the CRM and save the search for them. Your leads will not be able to see the **Super Saved Search** so you will need to set it up for them. 
 
[<img src="images/crm/saved_searches_5.jpg"/>](images/crm/saved_searches_5.jpg)

Here is the full walkthrough:

<html><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Nl7hlatfTM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></html>

####Familiarize yourself with the Lead's Dashboard####

[<img src="images/crm/saved_searches_6.jpg"/>](images/crm/saved_searches_6.jpg)

**1. Saved Searches**

  - Press View to view the current search settings.
  - Press Edit to refine the search settings.
  - Press Rename to name the search. Searches are otherwise named after the date saved.
  - Adjust the notification frequencies.
  - When the lead is no longer interested in the saved search, they can delete it.
Remember to save when adjusting searches.

[<img src="images/crm/saved_searches_7.jpg"/>](images/crm/saved_searches_7.jpg)

**2. Favorites**

  * This tab will show you all of the leads current favorited properties.

NOTE: If an existing lead (or a user logged in as a lead) deletes all of the saved searches before saving a new search, a new welcome will be sent to the lead.

####Why hasn't my lead received a property update email?####

The lead's saved search might be too specific producing very narrow results.  If this is the case, it is highly probably that none of the properties have had any update activity which would trigger the property update emails.

**Please note** that the leads will not receive a property update email the moment you save a search for them. They will receive an email in the following day(s), depending on the frequency set for the saved search.
If you would like for them to receive an email regarding the current listings that matches the saved search criteria, you will need to manually send them an email with a link to the search results page.

The Property Update emails will only contain new listings going forward that matches their saved search criteria
