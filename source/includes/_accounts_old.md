## Logging In

<img src="images/logging_in.gif"/>

The Real Geeks Login is a single sign-on system used across all of our products. If you login to the [Accounts](https://accounts.realgeeks.com/) system, you are also logged in to your Real Geeks Site Admin, Lead Manager, and vice versa, provided that you have the permissions needed to access them by your Site Owner.

If you are having trouble logging in be sure to use the email you used to sign up for your account with.

If you have any questions, please contact support: [Support](https://www.realgeeks.com/support/)

## Websites

Here you will find a listing of sites you own or contribute to. On the left you will find links to your Real Geeks Site Admin and the Lead Manager for that site. On the right is an “Edit/Add Users” button which will bring up permissions for each user that has been added to that site.

## User Management

The User Manager gives you the ability to see an overview of each user’s permissions on the left, the ability to edit permissions, edit a user, remove a user, and add a user on the right.

<aside class="notice">If you have not used the permissions system yet or you have not yet been an administrator for the accounts system– you need to have the registered owner of the site (i.e. the person paying the bills) to proceed any further.</aside>

&nbsp; | Follow These Steps:
---| ---
1. | Login to [Accounts](https://accounts.realgeeks.com/) with your email and password.
2. | Click on the “Websites” heading in the accounts management system. It is now, by default, your homepage.
3. | Select the site you would like to modify by clicking the orange “Edit/Add Users” button on the right.
4. | If the user does not yet exist, you'll then be taken to a screen that will allow you to create the new user.

### Adding an Existing User or Creating a New User

&nbsp; | Follow These Steps:
---| ---
1. | Click the “Add User” button on the right-hand side of the permission system or the green button at the bottom.
2. | Enter an email address for the user in the box on the left-hand side.
3. | If the user already exists in the system, you will be presented with something resembling the screen below. At which point, if you click “Add Existing User” you are done.
4. | If the user does not yet exist, you'll then be taken to a screen that will allow you to create the new user.
5. | Finally, once the user is created or the existing user is added, you can then just begin modifying permissions.
