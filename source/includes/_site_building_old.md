# Site Building

Site Building can be done from the backend of your site.  You can access the backend of your site from [Accounts](https://accounts.realgeeks.com/).

It is important to understand the different sections you can edit as well as how to edit them.

For example, after creating a content page, you will generally want to link to the content page you created.  To do so, you will need to take the slug from this content page, and add it to another section of your site, commonly the sidebar or navigation.

In this section we will explain the different elements, how they interact, and the best practices for building out your site.

##Content Editor

We have a great content editor to give you a familiar word processing-type environment for creating your pages. All the formatting essentials are covered and an advanced HTML entry function is available for when the editing tools are not enough.

The content editor works like a stripped-down word processor. Simply type in text, then format it by highlighting it and clicking one of the buttons.

The best way to learn is to experiment until you achieve the desired formatting. Don't worry, it's pretty easy. Here's a cheat sheet:

##Page Types

The different types of pages that are available work together to help generate leads on the website. Please read to understand the purpose of each page and how to best utilize them to achieve your goals.

###Homepage

The home page is the main landing page of your site, you can expect most of your web traffic to begin here.

A good home page will contain each of these basic page elements:

Item | Description
---| ---
Logo and header image | Brand you site and add some above-the-fold artwork
Navigation bar | General navigation within the site
Quick search form | The primary call-to-action on the page
Main content area | Here is your opportunity to write about the area in which you do business
Sample property listings | Provide a few listings for search engine indexing
Sidebars | Organize your links, add social media content
Footers | Provide business contact information, link to external services

###Area / Content / Featured Listings

####Area Pages

An Area page is essentially a content page dedicated to a geographical area. You can set up area pages for regions, cities, or neighborhoods. The Quick Search form at the top of an area page is narrowed down to just the area specified in the Area name field.

You can link Area pages in the sidebars and navigation bars described [here](/#linking-and-navigation).

####Content Pages

Content pages can contain arbitrary content, but for your convenience, we've provided a few handy templates for common use cases.

####Featured Property Page

Allows you to pull in listings for specific locations and display them on a designated page.

How to set up featured property listings:

###Advanced Search Forms

The Advanced search form gives you the chance to customize the search on your site to include search fields that capture the essence of the real estate market in your area. The information we have to work with originates from your MLS board. The quality and usefulness of any particular search fields depends on how well the MLS board curates this data.

###About Page

The About page is set up for you and your company. This page is meant to promote your company as well as display your Agents in an orderly manner.

###Agent Detail

An Agent Detail Page is generated from the About Page. This page is created for providing detailed bios of your agents.
