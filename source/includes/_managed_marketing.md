### How Our Google Pay-Per-Click Program Works ###
Here are some details about how this lead generation program works. With this program, the lead generation is completely managed for you, so you don't have to worry about ad creation, keywords, or anything on the Google side. Instead, you'll be able to spend your time focusing on converting your leads to clients and closing deals!

**Length of Commitment** 6 months (we chose 6 months because this is how long it takes to accurately  estimate your return on investment with these leads. Google is able to target leads with varying levels of intent based on their searches, and many may still be early in the home buying process. This is great for agents because it gives you the opportunity to get both ends of a transaction for leads, as they are not all first-time homebuyers). After six months the commitment continues month-to-month with a 30 day notice.

**Types of Ads** We will run a variety of ads focusing on your target areas based on the conversations we have to build out a campaign strategy. These will reflect areas and types of homes you'd like to focus on in your market.

**Average Cost per Lead** Though we can't guarantee cost per lead or lead quantity, we typically see a cost per lead between $7-$25 with this program. Of course, this can vary depending on your market and targeting.

**Billing** Depending on the day you'd like to start, we'll charge you a prorated management fee and marketing budget to get your ad campaign live ASAP. Your recurring bill date will be moved to the first of the month. Of course, we'll apply a platform credit that first month to adjust for your change in bill date if necessary.

**Pricing** For this service, we have two different management levels for you to chose from, with a variety of different budget options.

**LEVEL 1:**

$300 management fee/month +

  * $300 monthly marketing budget ($600 total)

If you’ve been around for a while, you’ve probably at least dabbled with Facebook ads before. Many of the client’s we’ve spoken to saw the following trends with Facebook:

  * Good cost per lead
  * Bad contact validity
  * Lots of sign-ups who are just looking
  * Low return on investment

Facebook Lead Ads have gone a long way towards addressing these issues and bringing leads from Facebook on par with those from Google. Lead Ads show an increased contact validity while keeping the efficient cost per lead.

### How Our Facebook Lead Ad Program Works ###
Here are some details about how this lead generation program works. With this program, the lead generation is completely managed for you, so you don't have to worry about ad creation, audiences, or anything on the Facebook side. Instead, you'll be able to spend your time focusing on converting your leads to clients and closing deals!

**Length of Commitment** 6 months (we chose 6 months because this is how long it takes to accurately estimate your ROI with these leads. Because Facebook proactively targets potential leads, they are usually early in the home buying process. This is great for agents because it gives you the opportunity to get both ends of a transaction for leads, as they are not all first-time homebuyers). After six months the commitment continues month-to-month with a 30 day notice.
 
**Types of Ads** You can choose two different ad sets, and each ad set can target one area. These should reflect areas and types of homes you'd like to focus on in your market.

**Average Cost per Lead** Though we can't guarantee cost per lead or lead quantity, we typically see a cost per lead between $4-$10 with this program. Of course, this can vary depending on your market and your targeting.

**Billing** Depending on the day you'd like to start, we'll charge you a prorated management fee and marketing budget to get your ad campaigns live ASAP. Your recurring bill date will be moved to the first of the month. Of course, we'll apply a platform credit that first month to adjust for your change in bill date if necessary. 

**Pricing** For this service, we have two different management levels for you to choose from, with a variety of different budget options.

**LEVEL 1:**

$300 management fee/month +

  * $200 monthly marketing budget ($500 total)
