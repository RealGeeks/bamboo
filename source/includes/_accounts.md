### Account Permissions Overivew
The easy-to-use Real Geeks site features one versatile login username and password that provides access to all sites owned by the site owner, administrative pages, the lead manager, and the billing management system. Because one login can provide access to this variety of information, it is necessary for the registered owner of the site to manually set permissions regarding which places each user has access to in their system. Once the registered owner sets the original permissions, he or she can grant permissions and authorize people to be an administrator for the accounts system.

#### How to Access the Permissions System
1. Login to https://accounts.realgeeks.com/ with your email and password.
2. Click the “Websites” heading in the accounts management system. It is now, by default, your homepage.
3. Select the site you would like to modify from the list provided by clicking on “Edit/Add Users“
4. Once a site is selected, you’ll be in the permissions system.
